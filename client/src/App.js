  /* check the console, you will see that the initial state
  * "just an example" shows up first. Then the function useEffect
  * fires and the api request is made to the server but it takes
  * a second which is why you see "just an example" show up first.
  *
  * So now we can access the data from the api request using data.
  * data acts just like a variable name BUT it is imutable and cant be changed
  * like you cant do data = "something"
  * it wont work, you can only set it with setData
  * think of it like getters and setters in object oriented programming.
  *
  * Also every time setData is used and state "data" is changed, EVERY component that
  * uses data as a prop or whatever will also update so these changes will happen
  * right away across the app.
